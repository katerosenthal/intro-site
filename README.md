## Hello!

This page as it currently appears was created using github tutorials for a university class on version control. As I am still very new to coding and do not have any projects or code that I would like to showcase or share, this is simply me practicing what I have learned about Markdown so far.

### Just Practicing

You can write in **bold**

You can write in *italics*

You can write in `Code`

# Big Header
## Medium Header
### Small Header

```markdown
This should appear in a box 
```

Clicking [Here](https://katerosenthal.github.io/) should bring you right back to my page.

The other part of this assignment included creating a brand new repository. Mine can be found [Here](https://github.com/katerosenthal/hello-world).
